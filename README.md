# ComputerVision3D_Fundamental

You need Imagine++ library (http://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++/)

We take as input two images slightly shifted. 

We compute Fundamental Matrix with RANSAC algorithm

then when user clicks on a point in an image, we display the epipolar line in the other image.
